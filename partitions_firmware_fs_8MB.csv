# Filesystem partition notes:
# - We mount LittleFS from the partition labeled "fwfs" (see [`cpp.firmware_fs::begin()`](src/firmware_fs.cpp:30)).
# - ESPConnect and similar tools choose the filesystem driver based on the partition subtype.
# - Arduino-ESP32's `gen_esp32part.py` in this toolchain does not recognize the keyword `littlefs`
#   in CSV files, but it does accept the numeric subtype value. LittleFS subtype is 0x83.
