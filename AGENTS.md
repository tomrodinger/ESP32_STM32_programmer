# Agent Instructions

Refer to `README.md` for project details and architecture.

## Critical Workflow Rules

1.  **Verify Before Completion**: You MUST compile and run/test the code before declaring the task complete. Do not assume code works just because it looks correct. Use `pio run` to verify compilation.
2.  **Concise Completion**: When finishing a task, do NOT provide a long summary of what you did. No human reads that. Simply state: "I'm done and I have fully tested the code."
